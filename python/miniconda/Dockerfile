# Install the package as normal:
COPY environment.yml .

RUN conda env create -f environment.yml 

# Install conda-pack:
RUN conda install -c conda-forge conda-pack

# We've put venv in same path it'll be in final image,
# so now fix up paths:

# base image since the Conda env also includes Python interpreter
FROM debian:stable-slim AS runtime

# Create a non-root user
RUN useradd -m appuser
